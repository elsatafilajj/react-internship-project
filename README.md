# Stuck-Platform

A real-time collaborative web app for teams to brainstorm, organize, and vote on ideas using an interactive virtual board. Users can create rooms, add sticky notes, drag-and-drop ideas, and discuss them in real time. Built with NestJS (backend), PostgreSQL, and ReactJS (frontend) â€” all in TypeScript.
